            <h3>Brief overview</h3>
                <p>The Ford Mustang is an iconic American muscle car the was first produced in the 1964 model year, and is still being produced today. 
                    The orginal "pony car" Mustang was produced from 1964 to 1968. The project was lead by the one and only Lee Iacocca. 
                    It was designed to be a stylish yet practical and affordable sports car, one of the first in the US market.
                    Following the "pony car" era the Mustang assumed its spot in history as one of the iconic American muscle cars. 
                    Since 1964 there have been seven generations of Mustang produced, each era has its own distinct style and personality.
                    These later generations boasted powerful drivetrains and larger bodies with bold, aggressive styling.
